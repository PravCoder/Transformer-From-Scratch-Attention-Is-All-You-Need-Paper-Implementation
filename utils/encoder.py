Methods:
    forward(): single forward pass of an entire encoder through its N identical layers
Attributes:
    num_layers: the numebr of N identical layers/block stacke don top of each other in the fullencdoer. Controls the number of times token embeddings are refined through attention + feedforward sublayers
    d_model: the dimension of the embedding vector for each token. Controls the size fo all projection matrices in attention and feedforward networks.
    num_heads: number of attention heads used in multi-head attention mechanism
    d_ff: inner dimension of the feedforward network inside each encoder block
    dropout: probability of randomly zeroing elements during training, used in self.drop1 & self.drop2.
